''' This is an example file to produce LMN coordinates and FOTE null line
metrics as in Alho+2024. Thresholding the output data with ``vg_lmn_neutral_line_distance ~< 0.2`` 
is the suggested way of detecting neutral lines with the FOTE method.

Usage:
    python neutral_lines.py file_in file_out

    file_in:
        Input vlsv file with at least the following data: ``CellID``, ``vg_b_vol``, ``vg_jacobian_b``, and perturbed
        B jacobian components ``vg_dperbxvoldx``
    
    file_out:
        Output vlsv file (will be overwritten). 


    
Input parameters:
    file_in:
