This is a recipe for plotting ordinary space variable using
matplotlib. It will plot three subplots, which have the correct aspect
ratio and whose zooms are tied so that all of them zoom in the same
fashion.

Content:

load.ipy: Loads data from a vlsv file (a restart file in this case), and prepares the data so that it can be plotted
plot.ipy: Plots the data 

Usage:

1) Edit the files (load.ipy, plot.ipy) for your case
2) Start up ipython 
2) Load and prepare data in ipython 
   %run load.ipy
3) plot data in ipython after loading:
   %run plot.ipy
